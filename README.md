# Spatial_SQL
A introductory workshop on Spatial SQL using PostGIS


# Concepts

## What is a database?

You already use a database if you've done GIS.

## What is a Spatial Database?
A spatial database is just a normal database with a column that holds the geometry information.
The geometry/geography information is sored as a Binary Large Opject (BLOB).

## What is Spatial SQL?
Spatial SQL is regular SQL but with some additional functions that perform spatial analysis.

## Why do you want to learn spatial databases and spatial SQL?
* It's a good way to work with large amounts of data
* Faster processing of data compared with working through a graphical user interface.
* Typically faster to run a process in a spatial database than in a GIS program
* Store lots of data (compare with shapefile's 70m row limit)
* One database file stores many, many datasets --> easier data management
* Write a query instead of making a new file (no exporting of results to shapefile necessary!)

## What makes this hard?
If you're a GIS user, you're probably used to a graphical user interface (GUI) where you can see your data, have tools with guided interfaces, and can see the results of your processing immediately.
These aren't things you get with a typical database, however, we can connect our database to QGIS so we can see our results and with practice, you will get used to the typical workflow and seeing everything won't be so necessary.

## Databases that support Spatial SQL:
* Oracle
* MySQL
* SQL Server
* Spatial Lite
* PostGRES --> PostGIS
* Others too!

## Concepts:
1. Geography != Geometry
    i. Geography is QGS84
    i. Geography has limited spatial functions
    i. Geography is 2D
    i. Geography is faster for generating visualizations
    i. Geometry is for full analysis
    i. Geometry can be 3D

# Hands-On Tutorial

## Installation
Installing postgreSQL and PostGIS is a little tricky, but you only have to do it once.  The order of installation is important. 

Download & install these programs in this order:
1. postgreSQL 10: https://www.postgresql.org/download/   = the database program that’s going to make all of this work
    i. The installer should walk you through installation options.  
    i. Write down the port (keeping the default is fine) and password you choose.  
    i. Pick a password you like to type because it comes up a lot.
2. PostGIS: https://postgis.net/install/  (windows latest bundle: http://download.osgeo.org/postgis/windows/pg10/)
    i. PostGIS makes postgreSQL have spatial capabilities (much like a super power) and install the bundle option because it comes with things you’ll need, saving a few steps
        i. Make sure you’ve installed postgreSQL first
        i. The installer should walk you through the installation options.

## Make a Database
We need to make an empty database to put our files into.

1. Open PGAdmin 4.  This is the graphical user interface for postgreSQL that should have installed with the postgreSQL files. If PGAdmin 4 doesn’t start or gives an error, you may need to start the service that makes it run.  In the Windows search bar, search “services”.  In the Services window, right click postgresql-x64-10 and choose “start”.

1. In the browser panel on the left side of the pgAdmin 4 window, click the + to expand Servers and PostgreSQL 10.  When it asks for your password, give it the password you wrote down during the installation process. (If it gives you an error, start the service... see above.)

1. Right click on PostgreSQL 10 -> Create -> Database

1. In the Database name field, give it a name with lowercase letters.  I named mine maptime.  Leave the owner drop-down on postgres.  Click Save.

1. Expand the Databases entry in the Browser panel to see your new database in the list.


## Enable Extensions
Right now, our database is just a regular database without spatial functions.  We need to enable the PostGIS extension and the extensions that help us geocode.

1. Open the Query Tool: in the Tools menu at the top of the screen, select “Query Tool”.  The top section of the query tool is where you type SQL commands.  Underneath this is where the results of your queries are displayed.

1. Enable the PostGIS extension to give the database spatial capabilities by copying and pasting this code into the query tool and clicking the run button (it looks like a lightning bolt… why?  I don’t know.):

```
CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
```

I know this doesn't make much sense to you right now, but that's ok.  We just need to get the database tool running, and then we can start learning.


## Tour of the interface

## Load some data

## Anatomy of a query = what do they typically look like, caps/no caps, end with ;

## Some non-spatial Queries:
Start simple: SELECT * FROM table;
Add a WHERE clause: SELECT * FROM table WHERE column = 'something';
Add a function: SELECT COUNT(column) FROM table WHERE column = 'something'

## Spatial Query Examples:
SELECT ST_AsText(geom) FROM table;
SELECT ST_Length(geom), strname FROM street_centerlines;
SELECT ST_Length(ST_TRANSFORM(geom)), strname FROM street_centerlines;
SELECT objectid, ST_AREA(ST_TRANSFORM(geom)) FROM buildings;

## Projections:
SELECT UpdateGeometrySRID('db_table', 'geometry_field', EPSG);

## Spatial Analysis:
